        <p>
          Don't be distracted in your normal workflow.
          ThreadVis does not change the default layout of Thunderbird,
          it adds itself to unused space in the header bar.

        <p>
          Jump back and forth between messages in a thread, regardless of folder location.
          Don't be forced to keep all messages in a single folder to display the thread
          hiearchy, sort messages any way you like and still make sense of the context
          the mails were sent in.
